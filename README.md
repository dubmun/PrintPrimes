Code for Software Craftsmanship programming exercise

The goal of this programming exercise is to take existing code and make it better.
The code comes from Robert Martin's (aka Uncle Bob) excellent book "Clean Code". 
It is a version of a program written by Donald Knuth, who is a notable computer scientist.

Things that you might do include:

Convert it to your language of choice.

Refactor it so the code is more clean.

Add unit tests.

Create a version of the program with a UI: web app, mobile app, console app, etc.
